         ,DataDescription:" 2022 Indian Hindi-language drama film[2] written and directed by Vivek Agnihotri.[6] The film presents a fictional storyline[1][7] centred around the 1990 exodus of Kashmiri Hindus from Indian-administered Kashmir.[8][9] It depicts the exodus and the events leading up to it[10] as a genocide,[11][12][13][14] a framing considered inaccurate by scholars.[15][16] The film claims that such facts were suppressed by a conspiracy of silence."
         ,DataDetailDescription:"The Kashmir Files stars Mithun Chakraborty, Anupam Kher, Darshan Kumar, and Pallavi Joshi.[19] The plot follows a Kashmiri Hindu college student, raised by his exiled grandfather and shielded from the knowledge of the circumstances of the death of his parents. After his grandfather's death, the student, who had come to believe at college that the exodus was benign, becomes driven to uncover the facts of his family's deaths. The plot alternates between the student's quest in the present time, 2020, and his family's travails of thirty years before. The film was released in theatres on 11 March 2022.[6] It has been a commercial success,[1][20] seemingly benefitting from promotion by India's ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and tax benefits",

        DataDescription:"Shah Rukh Khan's Pathaan continues to create a havoc at the box-office. The film has soared past the Rs 600 crore mark worldwide. The movie earlier garnered a lot of controversy and recently director Siddharth Anand opened up about the same. On the other hand, according to the reports, Janhvi Kapoor and Varun Dhawan's Bawaal has been postponed..",
        DataDetailDescription:"Shah Rukh Khan returned to the big screen earlier this year in a lead role with Pathaan and shattered box office records. Salman Khan made a cameo in the movie as Tiger and it led to a roar when two superstars, fondly known as Karan  Arjun of Indian cinema, came together for an action-packed sequence. Siddharth Anand recently talked about the post-credit scene where the actors are sitting on the railway track on the bridge talking about the spy universe, which was also a meta moment about their star power.At the News 18 Rising India Summit 2023, Siddharth Anand said, The sequence you watched in post credits, that was the end of that train sequence He added that they struggled with the tone of the scene so we came up with the idea that make it about them in real life and well find humour in that.He continued, But then we chopped that from the film. It ended how that sequence is ending and the film ended. When we saw the film after the final mix, Uday Chopra came up with this idea that we should put that scene at the end of the film. And we all realized, Why did we not think of it Its mind blowing. Credit to Uday Chopra for that suggestion.Siddharth Anand said that he was clear that he wanted to add humour to Salman Khans appearance as Tiger. I wanted it to be funny because you know that they Shah Rukh and Salman will destroy the goons. You are already prepared. How will they do it is what the audience wants to know. But the X factor is the humour. Shah Rukh and Salman have such great chemistry with each other. They are very good friends, they have great understanding and they are like that off-camera also, so I wanted to capture that, he said.Speaking of the Karan Arjun reference, he said that they wanted to play to the gallery, front footed. He made Salman Khan say Bhaag Pathaan bhaag which was a callback to Karan Arjuns Bhaag Arjun bhaag. The director said, Salman was a little shy but I pushed him to do it.Meanwhile, Tiger 3 arrives in theatres on Diwali 2023. Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan will reunite again in that film. SRK will shoot for 7 days for a massive action sequence in Tiger 3 that is sure to leave people on the edge of their seats! The film also stars Katrina Kaif as Zoya & Emraan Hashmi as Tigers nemesis.",

        DataDescription:"It was an expectedly low Saturday for Gumraah as Rs. 0.75 crore* came in. On Friday the film had collected Rs. 1.10 crores and the reason that it went past the Rs. 1 crore was due to it being a partial holiday of Good Friday. Hence, it was inevitable that a drop will come on Saturday. More so, since there was no real buzz around the film prior to release and post its arrival too the word of mouth wasn’t quite spreading.",
        DataDetailDescription:"The fun-filled adventure comedy Murder Mystery (2019), starring Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston, was released in 2019 and emerged as one of the most-watched films of all time on Netflix. The film achieved a lot of popularity thanks to its funny moments and the chemistry between the lead actors. Hence, the sequel, Murder Mystery 2, has been much awaited by audiences all over the world. The Indian audiences are particularly curious to see the wedding sequence. Its glimpse has been shown in the trailers and has heightened the excitement of the viewers in this country.It has now come to light that Murder Mystery 2, which was released on March 31, has a connection with Hrithik Roshan, Varun Dhawan, Sidharth Malhotra, Parineeti Chopra and Elli AvrRam This is because their popular songs could be heard in the background in the sangeet sequence.The first song that is played is Khadke Glassy from the Sidharth Malhotra-Parineeti Chopra starrer Jabariya Jodi (2019). This is followed by the much-loved Ghungroo from War (2019), featuring Hrithik Roshan and Vaani Kapoor and Elli AvrRams item song Chamma Chamma from Fraud Saiyaan (2019). Although not clearly heard as the aforementioned tracks, Husnn Hai Suhaana from the Varun Dhawan-Sara Ali Khan starrer Coolie No 1 (2020) is played next. All these songs have got a due mention in the end credits.During the sangeet dance performance scene, the original song King Dee Wedding can be heard. It is composed by Avinash Chandrachud and Vishwajeet Joshi. Recently, they revealed that getting Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston to dance to their Punjabi dance number, sung by Farhad Bhiwandiwala, was an experience of a lifetime.In a recent interaction with the media, Jennifer Aniston spoke about wearing a beautiful white lehenga for this said sequence. Designed by Manish Malhotra, she revealed that it took three months to create the attire. She added, It was extremely heavy and I wasn't expecting that. So much respect for all the beautiful women of India who have to not only wear it but dance. We had a really good time.Murder Mystery 2 is the story of a detective couple who attend an Indian friend's wedding. But things go wrong when the groom gets kidnapped and the couple gets involved in the chaos and madness.",

        DataDetailDescription:"Few lives in our time are as dramatic and enigmatic as the saga of Sanjay Dutt. Coming from a family of cinema legends, he himself became a film star, then saw dizzying heights and darkest depths: adulation of die-hard fans, unending battles with various addictions, brushes with the underworld, prison terms, loss of loved ones, and the haunting speculation that he might be a terrorist. Sanju is in turns a hilarious and heartbreaking exploration of one man's battle against his own wild self and the formidable external forces trying to crush him. It depicts the journey of a man through everything that life can throw at him. Some true stories leave you thinking did this really happen ? This is one such unbelievable story that happens to be true.",

With the help of Himanshu Shukla, the Prime Minister's principal secretary, he leads a team to conduct a second nuclear test series. The only major threat lurking is the American Lacrosse satellite which caught the first test preparations, further causing America to warn India about such future tests. With their patriotic hearts and unbreakable spirits, Ashwat and his team race against time to conduct the tests confidentially while the country's worsening political scenario as well as the presence of spies from US and Pakistan puts them into both mental as well as physical challenges.",

        DataDetailDescription:"Lagaan: Once Upon a Time in India (transl. Agricultural tax) is a 2001 Indian Hindi epic sports drama film written and directed by Ashutosh Gowariker. The film was produced by Aamir Khan, who stars alongside debutant Gracy Singh and British actors Rachel Shelley and Paul Blackthorne. Set in 1893, during the late Victorian period of India's colonial British Raj, the film follows the inhabitants of a village in Central India, who, burdened by high taxes and several years of drought, are challenged by an arrogant British Indian Army officer to a game of cricket as a wager to avoid paying the taxes they owe. The villagers face the arduous task of learning a game that is alien to them and play for a victory.Produced on a budget of ₹25 crore (US$5.3 million), Lagaan was the most expensive Indian film at the time of its release. It faced multiple challenges during production: Khan was initially skeptical to star in a sports film, and later, prospective producers called for budget cuts and script modifications. Eventually, the film would become the maiden project of Aamir Khan Productions, and mark Khan's foray into film production. Gowariker was inspired by aspects of the sports drama Naya Daur (1957) in developing the film. The language featured in the film was based on Awadhi, but was diluted with standard Hindi for modern audiences. Principal photography took place in villages near Bhuj. Nitin Chandrakant Desai served as art director, while Bhanu Athaiya was the costume designer. The original soundtrack was composed by A. R. Rahman, with lyrics written by Javed Akhtar.Lagaan was theatrically released in India on 15 June 2001, clashing with Gadar: Ek Prem Katha. It received critical acclaim for Gowariker's direction, Khan's performance and the film's anti-imperialist stance. With earnings of ₹65.97 crore (US$13.98 million) during its initial release, the film was the third highest-grossing Hindi film of 2001. Lagaan was screened at numerous international film festivals and garnered multiple accolades. It was the third Indian film to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film after Mother India (1957) and Salaam Bombay! (1988). Lagaan became the most-awarded film at the 47th Filmfare Awards with eight wins, including Best Film, Best Director for Gowariker and Best Actor for Khan.

Panchayat : Season 2 of Panchayat takes us back to Phulera, as Panchayat Secretary Abhishek Tripathi continues to struggle between feeling at home and wanting more for himself. The cast — led by Jitendra Kumar, Neena Gupta, Raghubir Yadav, Chandan Roy, and Faisal Malik — touch upon slightly more serious, emotional themes this season, and pull it off, while maintaining the show's gentle comedy.2. Delhi Crime : Season 1 of Delhi Crime, based on the Nirbhaya case, released in 2019. While a difficult watch, the gritty procedural was an instant success. Released in 2022, Season 2, detailing a series of gruesome home invasions, is no different. In five fast-paced episodes, we go back into the world of Delhi crime and Delhi police, made very real by the standout cast, led by Shefali Shah.3. Rocket Boys : Based on the lives of Dr. Homi J. Bhabha and Dr. Vikram Sarabhai,Rocket Boys is a fascinating peek into India's formative years in the field of aeronautics. Jim Sarbh and Ishwak Singh's easy camaraderie translates well on screen and doesn't let the show drag. To lend authenticity to the story, classical dancer Mallika Sarabhai, Vikram Sarabhai's daughter, was consulted for information about their home and lifestyle.4. Human : If you've ever wondered how unethical and dangerous the business of saving lives can be, Human, a show about the dark side of Indian pharma, has the answer for you. The gripping psychological thriller will compel you to binge-watch the full season, especially with Shefali Shah's portrayal of a ruthless pharma boss.5. Apharan : Much like the first season, the second season of Apharan fully embraces its over-the-top, weird world and doesn't give the very aptly cast Arunoday Singh time to breathe. There's suspense, action, that kitschy '70s vibe, and so much more that keeps fans hooked through the 11-episode run.6. Gullak : In its third season, Gullak continued to charm fans with its disarming portrayal of the middle-class Mishra family and their problems, so relatable that for many it's almost like watching their own parents and siblings on screen. In five crisp episodes, Jameel Khan, Geetanjali Kulkarni, Vaibhav Raj Gupta, and Harsh Mayar prove yet again that ordinary is not always boring.7. NCR Days : Not your average college show, NCR Days is the story of Monu, played by Nikhil Vijay, who comes to NCR from Jodhpur for an MBA, primarily so he can marry his girlfriend back home. In his journey of growing, changing, and finding himself, he makes new friends and learns some hard lessons. Writer-director Ambrish Verma doesn't just create a rich, complex world in only five episodes, but also plays a central character in the show.8. Abhay : Season 3 of Abhay continues to follow UP Police SP Abhay Pratap Singh (played by Kunal Kemmu) as he battles personal demons and solves gruesome crimes. This season differs from earlier seasons in that it pits him against one central villain — a charismatic cult leader planning mass murder, played to perfection by Vijay Raaz. Kunal's performance keeps you rooting for Abhay through some very tumultuous times.9. Campus Diaries : Featuring some very popular content creators, like Harsh Beniwal and Saloni Gaur, Campus Diaries tells the coming-of-age stories of six students at Excel University. They navigate love, life, and all the angst and challenges that come with learning how to be an adult in the real world.10.

Mishri aka Meesha (Sara Ali Khan) returns to her hometown in Gujarat to meet her father (Shataf Ahmed Figar) after years. Meesha cant walk and had separated from her father after a tragedy in the palace and also after her father remarried. As soon as Meesha returns, shes welcomed by her stepmother, Rukmani (Chitrangda Singh). Surprisingly, her father is nowhere to be found. Rukmani and others tell her that he had to urgently head to their factory to pacify the agitated workers on strike. Meesha finds the reason unconvincing. She calls her father but his phone is switched off. Moreover, eerie things happen to her at night that make her believe that her father is dead. While Rukmani rubbishes these claims, Kapil (Vikrant Massey), a faithful servant of the palace, decides to help her. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Neha Veena Sharma and Pavan Kirpalani's story is alright but could have been translated into a fine suspense flick. Neha Veena Sharma and Pavan Kirpalani's screenplay, however, is clichéd and unexciting for most parts. The writers take a lot of time for the build-up. Amit Mehta's dialogues (additional dialogues by Neha Veena Sharma) are routine.Pavan Kirpalani's direction is a mixed bag. He succeeds in making good use of the location and in creating an eerie, mysterious atmosphere. A particular scene, shot in the salt pan, also stands out for its execution. However, despite a runtime of 111 minutes, the film seems too long as its quite slow. Some scenes test the patience of the viewers. Moreover, the template of a character seeing something mysterious but failing to prove it to the rest of the characters has been beaten-to-death.Thankfully, the suspense in the last 15 minutes is shocking and unexpected. The makers also tie all the loose ends at this point and the film ends on a thrilling and justified note. This majorly saves the film.",

However, not even Apple is immune to the economic downturn.According to a fresh report, the Cupertino-based company is now also eliminating a few roles. Apple isnt the only company seeing layoffs recently though – its also joined by EA, Kyndryl, and others. We take a look at the major sackings this week and the last here.A Bloomberg report citing people familiar with the matter revealed that Apple is eliminating a small number of roles within its corporate retail teams. Its not clear how many people will be affected but the report does say that the number is “likely very small.Still, while Apple has finally given in and has joined the likes of Google, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft, its layoffs are far fewer in number compared to these companies, which have each announced tens of thousands of job cuts. So far, the company managed to avoid layoffs by laying off contractors, delaying bonuses, reducing travel budgets, and pushing back projects instead.",

        DataDetailDescription:"Google is rolling out a bunch of new features to its search engine. With summer just around the corner, many are looking forward to travelling to beat the heat. With that in mind, Google is introducing new ways that can help improve the trip planning experience.Browse hotels Starting this week, Google will roll out the ability to browse and discover hotels on mobile devices. If you search for a hotel and tap on the view more button, Google will let you explore the property in what it calls a swipeable story format where you can go through the photos of the hotel so you know what it looks like.Explore more Google is also making it easier to find more things to do when you are travelling to a new place. If you are visiting a popular place or want to go to some other place, searching for an attraction or tour company will directly show the price associated along with a link that lets you book a ticket.Save money on flight tickets As it turns out, Google is also working to make it easy for users to save money on their next flight. Currently available as a pilot program for price guarantees in the United States, if users see a flight with the price guarantee badge, it means the price for the flight wont go any lower.The tech giant says that if the price goes down than what the badge mentioned, the company will pay the user the difference amount via Google Pay. However, the program is only available for those flight bookings made from Google on flights that depart from the United States.",

        DataDetailDescription:"When I first heard about the DigiYatra that would cut down the security check time at the Indian airports, I was intrigued to try it at my next trip. When the time came, I was left disappointed as I wasnt able to verify my name on my boarding pass using Aadhaar.This time around, I was running a bit late for airport and I wanted to give DigiYatra another try just to ensure I clear the security as quickly as possible. I was in a luck this time around as the booking had my correct name — Vivek U, thanks IndiGo for understanding people can also have single digit sur name.Some flight carriers want users have have a full second name with at least two characters (surname) while I just have a single initial on Aadhaar although I have a longer surname on my passport.Setting up the DigiYatra app Setting up the DigiYatra app is fairly simple. I downloaded the app from the Google Play Store and logged in using my phone number and quickly likned my Aadhaar, again using the OTP verification method. The app is also available for iPhones.Next I uploaded the flight ticket (pdf) for the DigiYatra to fetch all the details about the flight. Lastly, I had to take a selfie to authenticate and then allow the app to share my data with the airport, in this case its the kempegowda internernational airport.My experience of using DigiYatra At the initial security checkpoint, all I have to do is show my face to the digital kiosk and scan the barcode on the DigiYatra app. My face will then be verified with the one I shared earlier on the app along with my details via the Aadhaar that I have linked to the DigiYatra app.Once I got in, during the primary scanning area, I again posed at the digital kiosk and I was let in and all this took less than three minutes. The next 13 minutes were spend at putting by luggage through the xray scanner.Why I liked about the DigiYatra app It cuts down the time spent at security checks. I was able to cut the regular cue and then there is no need to carry any additional documents, where, your face works as the authenticator. I was able to complete my two-level security checks in just 15 minutes, which is the least time that it has ever taken to clear security at the Bengaluru airport.While there are no actual cons of using DigiYatra instead of conventional security process at the airport, I do have a few suggestions to make. The app should allow users to add more types of documents, such as a passport, where the majority of people have their full name.",

But with so many options to pick from, its difficult to stay loyal to a single service sometimes.If youve ever switched music services, then you must be familiar with the struggle of transferring each song and re-curating playlists. Helping ease that process is the nifty tool Soundiiz, which not only helps transfer entire playlists between music streaming apps but also helps keep them in sync. See how you can use the tool below.Getting started 1. Visit soundiiz.com on any device and log in using the button on the top right 2. Youll be directed straight to the Soundiiz web app 3. Tap the hamburger menu icon on the top left and hit the Connect Services button on the bottom left 4. Here, hit the Connect button for the services you wish to transfer/sync playlists between 1. Open the hamburger menu again and tap on Transfer under the Tools section 2. Select source (the service you wish to transfer your playlists from) and destination (the service you wish to transfer to) 3. Hit the Start button 4. Hit the pencil icon to select the playlist you wish to transfer. Note that youll only be able to transfer one playlist at a time if you are a free Soundiiz user 5. Keep hitting the Confirm buttons at the bottom to proceed until you see the Transferring screenWhile youll not be able to transfer more than one playlist at a time, you can always repeat the process until youve transferred all your playlists.Sync playlists If you keep juggling between two or more music streaming platforms, like Spotify and Apple Music for example, then keeping your playlists in sync between the two can be a tedious task. Soundiiz automates this process – when youve turned on sync between two playlists, adding a new track for one playlist will automatically insert the same track into another.",

        DataDetailDescription:"There is no worst feeling than losing your smartphone in this connected world. Phones are no more just devices that are used to make calls and send SMSs, phones are currently the modern world equivalent of swizz army knives, which can do a lot of things.Department of telecommunications, Govt of India has launched a new website named Central Equipment Identity Register (CEIR), allowing users to quickly lodge a complaint on a lost electronic gadget with an IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number such as a smartphone at a local police station. Using the CEIR website, users can block a stolen or lost mobile, unblock a found mobile, and they can even use the website to find more details about a second-hand smartphone.There is also a free Android and iOS app called KYM (know your mobile), which can also offer details on the status of your smartphone. It offers details like the status of the IMEI number, mobile manufacturer name, model number, and device type. All you have to have is the IMEI number (which will be available on the bill, box, and can also be accessed from the phone by dialling *#06#) and a phone number that can receive OTP.Right now, CEIR service is available in all 37 states (including union territories). To report a lost or stolen smartphone, one needs details like the mobile number of the SIM cards installed on the phone, the IMEI number, and a mobile purchase invoice.Similarly, you also need to file a complaint at your nearest police station as the digital copy of the police complaint is also required to block the phone along with the details of the smartphone owner. When you block a smartphone on CEIRs website, it will be blocklisted on the central database and wont be able to use it.",

        DataDetailDescription:"WhatsApp isnt exactly built to be used for business collaboration – people generally use apps like Slack for that. But in India, the Meta-owned platform is like a one-stop destination for all kinds of communication, work and otherwise, which can mess with the work-life balance sometimes.Things get worse when you work in an open office where people can outrightly peek into your system. Or you could be working at a cafe trying to mind your own business but are bothered by an invasive seatmate.Helping with these problems is a browser extension for WhatsApp Web that blurs out contact names, their profile pictures, and/or their messages on the chat list. Called WA Web Plus, the extension extends the chat apps feature list and enhances privacy. Heres how you can use it.While WA Web Pluss website claims that the extension is built for Chrome, it should also work on Edge, Opera, Vivaldi, and Brave, since they use the same engine (Chromium). We tested it out on Edge and it worked expectedly. However, browsers like Firefox and Safari are left out since they cannot install from the Chrome Web Store.The WA Web Pluss list of features is overwhelmingly lengthy but some features are obviously more useful than others: Blur recent messages, contact names, contact photos, and conversation messages: Your colleagues will only see what you want them to see when youve toggled these on.Set lock screen password: If you are in the habit of your leaving your PC open when you go on lunch breaks then its important to ensure that no one has access to your WhatsApp but you even when youre away.",

Renowned Hollywood costume designer Debra Mcguire had picked the ensemble for the actor.Adam Sandler, who was also part of the conversation, said Jennifer Aniston “looked stunning” in the lehenga.“Thank you, sweetheart,” she responded to her co-stars praise.“It was extremely heavy and I wasnt expecting that. So much respect for all the beautiful women of India who have to not only wear it, but dance their b**** off.

        DataDetailDescription:"John Wick: Chapter 4, the fourth installment in the Keanu Reeves assassin series, debuted with a franchise-best $73.5 million at the box office, according to studio estimates Sunday.The Lionsgate film, starring Reeves as the reluctant-but-not-that-reluctant killer John Wick, exceeded both expectations and previous opening weekends in the R-rated franchise. Since first launching in 2014 with John Wick ($14 million on its opening weekend), the Chad Stahelski-directed series has steadily grown as a ticket-seller with each sequel. The 2017 follow-up opened with $30.4 million, and the 2019 third chapter, Parabellum, debuted with $56.8 million.But Chapter 4, running two hours and 49 minutes and costing at least $100 million to produce, is the biggest film yet in the once-lean action series. Critics also said it was a franchise high point, scoring 95% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. The film, which drew a 69% male audience, added $64 million overseas. Its Lionsgates biggest success of the pandemic era.“When you make a fourth in an action franchise, you have to expect it to go down. That is the nature of these franchises,” said Joe Drake, chairman of Lionsgate Motion Picture Group. “But we kept seeing signals and it was wonderful to see the movie they delivered. We saw the audience wanting more.”Though John Wick has been bigger at the box office with each new release — an enviable and rare trajectory among Hollywood franchises — Chapter 4 brings some finality to Reeves character. The actor hasnt entirely dismissed continuing the series, telling interviewers “never say never.”Regardless, the franchise is set to keep humming. A spin-off titled Ballerina starring Ana de Armas and co-starring Reeves has already been shot. The miniseries The Continental, with Mel Gibson, is upcoming on Peacock.“Chad and Keanu have created this world and that world continues to expand. I dont know what all the edges of that world are, still,” said Drake. “As best they can, theyll continue to try to seduce Keanu to come back and do things. He gets beat up in these shows. He really does. And at the end hes like, Im not doing it anymore. Then you watch him sit in the theater and feel that audience.”“So were going to continue to look for ways to meet that demand.”The release of John Wick: Chapter 4, which included a surprise premiere at SXSW, was also bittersweet. Lance Reddick, who plays the Continental Hotel concierge, Charon, in the films, unexpectedly died at the age of 60 a week before the films release.But the success of John Wick: Chapter 4 adds to a strong start in 2023 for Hollywood. After ticket sales rebounded to about 67% of pre-pandemic levels last year, the release lineup is steadier and more packed this year. Sequels have led the way, including Creed III and Scream VI. Ticket sales are up 28% from last year, according to data firm Comscore.",

        DataDetailDescription:"“A toast to the disruptors,” Edward Nortons tech billionaire says in Rian Johnsons Oscar-nominated Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery.And why not a toast? Sundays Academy Awards wont give a prize for best villain, but if they did, Miles Bron would win it in a walk. (With apologies to the cloud of Nope.) He is an immediately recognisable type weve grown well acquainted with: a visionary (or so everyone says), a social media narcissist, a self-styled disrupter who talks a lot about “breaking stuff”.Miles Bron is just the Data in a long line of Hollywoods favorite villain: the tech bro. Looking north to Silicon Valley, the movie industry has found perhaps its richest resource of big-screen antagonists since Soviet-era Russia.Great movie villains dont come along often. The best-picture nominated Top Gun: Maverick, like its predecessor, was content to battle with a faceless enemy of unspecified nationality. Why antagonise international ticket buyers when Tom Cruise vs. Whomever works just fine but in recent years, the tech bro has proliferated on movie screens as Hollywoods go-to bad guy. Its a rise that has mirrored mounting fears over technologys expanding reach into our lives and increasing skepticism for the not always altruistic motives of the men – and it is mostly men – who control todays digital empires.Weve had the devious Biosyn Genetics CEO (Campbell Scott) in Jurassic World: Dominion, a franchise dedicated to the peril of tech overreach; Chris Hemsworths biotech overlord in Spiderhead; and Mark Rylances maybe-Earth-destroying tech guru in 2021′s Dont Look Up. Weve had Eisenberg, again, as a tech bro-styled Lex Luthor in 2016′s Batman v. Superman; Harry Mellings pharmaceutical entrepreneur in 2020s The Old Guard; Taika Waititis rule-breaking videogame mogul in 2021′s Free Guy; Oscar Isaacs search engine CEO in 2014′s Ex Machina; and the critical portrait of the Apple co-founder in 2015′s Steve Jobs.Kids movies, too, regularly channel parental anxieties about technologys impact on children. In 2021′s The Mitchells vs. the Machines, a newly launched AI brings about a robot apocalypse. Rons Gone Wrong (2021) also used a robot metaphor for smartphone addiction. And TV series have just as aggressively rushed to dramatize Big Tech blunders. Recent entries include: Ubers Travis Kalanick in Showtimes Super Pumped; Theranos Elizabeth Holmes in Hulus The Dropout; and WeWorks Adam and Rebekah Neumann in Apple TVs We Crashed. Some of these portrayals you could chalk up to Hollywood jealousy over the emergence of another California epicenter of innovation. But those worlds merged long ago. Many of the companies that released these movies are disrupters, themselves — none more than Netflix, distributor of Glass Onion. The streamer was cajoled into releasing Johnsons sequel more widely in theaters than any previous Netflix release. Estimates suggested the film collected some $15 million over opening weekend, the old fashioned way, but Netflix executives have said they dont plan to make a habit of such theatrical rollouts.",

Jordan made his directorial debut with Creed III, which pits his character Adonis against a childhood friend, Dame, played by Jonathan Majors. Its the first in the Rocky/Creed films to not feature Sylvester Stallone, who chose not to return because of creative differences.“This is beyond all of our expectations. And we knew that we had something special — we tested the movie and it tested great, but the public responded so resoundingly to it,” said Erik Lomis, MGMs head of distribution. “Everything went right here starting with the movie itself… It was just up to us not to break it when they gave it to us and we didnt.” Strong reviews helped Creed III, which is currently sitting at an 87% on Rotten Tomatoes, while audiences gave it an A- CinemaScore. The audience was largely male (63%), diverse (36% Black, 28% Latino, 23% white and 13% Asian/other) and young (55% between 18 and 34) according to exit polls.Over 80% of general audiences said the film was a “definite recommend.” With Black audiences, that number ballooned to 89%.“Ive been doing this a long time and thats rarefied air,” Lomis said. “People love the movie.”Its also the most expensive Creed film, with a reported production budget of $75 million, compared to the others which cost $35 million and $50 million. Internationally, Creed III earned $41.8 million from 75 markets, making its global debut $100.4 million.Its a big moment for Amazon, who acquired MGM for $8.5 billion last year, and could have simply released Creed III on its streaming service with a limited theatrical run. But they chose theatrical, and it paid “Amazon threw their weight behind this movie like only they can do,” Lomis said. “They supercharged the campaign with marketing support across all their verticals on the platform and beyond the platform. That shows a commitment to the theatrical business model from Amazon and MGM, which I think should be exciting to everybody.”The companys next major theatrical release is the Ben Affleck-directed Air, starring Matt Damon, out next month.",

The exciting news was announced at the Disney 2023 Annual Meeting of Shareholders Webcast on April 3 by Dwayne Johnson, who is reprising his role as Maui. Dwayne will also produce the new film alongside Aulii Carvalho, who voiced Moana in the animated feature.“Humbled to say were bringing #MOANAs beautiful story to the live action big screen!” Dwayne tweeted when the news was announced. “#MAUI changed my life (miss you grandpa) and Im honored to partner with @DisneyStudios to tell our story thru the realm of music & dance, which at the core is who we are as Polynesian people.”Disney fans are so excited that their favorites from Moana are being brought to life on the big screen. The 2016 animated film grossed over $640 million worldwide and was nominated for two Academy Awards. Disney just did live-action remakes of Cruella and Pinocchio, with Peter Pan & Wendy, The Little Mermaid, and Snow White on deck. We cant wait to see how Disneys live-action spin on Moana turns out. Heres everything you need to know about the upcoming film.There is no release date yet for the Moana live-action remake. Dwayne Johnson said in his announcement that the film is “still very early in the process” with “so much more work to be done.” That means we might not see the movie until 2024, if not 2025 or later.",

        DataDetailDescription:"Praanvi Gupta, a 7-year-old girl from India, has created a Guinness World Record by becoming the worlds youngest yoga instructor (female). She has been approved and certified as an RYT00 (Registered Yoga Teacher) by the Yoga Alliance Organisation after completing the 200-hour Yoga Teacher Training Course.According to the records website, shes even younger than the youngest yoga instructor (male) Reyansh Surani — also from India — who received his certification in July 2021, at the age of 9 years and 220 days.Praanvi, who would watch her mother practise yoga at home, began her yoga journey at the tender age of just 3.5 years. After months of observing and imitating her mother, the young girl started practising yoga on her own followed by enrolling in formal yoga classes at the age of seven .I want to spread the love of yoga to as many people as possible,” she told guinnessworldrecords.com, on her passion for teaching. As such, encouraged by her yoga instructor, she started the Yoga Teachers Training Program.She continued, “This journey was not an easy one, because of my regular school which was also ongoing. But, with great support from my teachers and parents, Im happy that I successfully completed and passed the qualification exam of Yoga Teachers Training Course.”",

        DataDetailDescription:"Exercise not only helps you control weight and combat health issues but is also a great mood elevator. As such, exercising regularly gives a boost to your self-esteem and makes you feel better. However, many of us do not find the time or motivation to exercise daily. But the good news is that, as per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, only 75 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity activity is enough to keep you healthy and fit. That comes around to approximately 10 to 11 minutes per day, not too bad, right?For this, we have got the perfect workout routine that you can do anywhere at any time. Here is the 10-minute workout routine by celebrity fitness instructor, Yasmin Karachiwala, to make you glow from the inside out.A plank pose, or Kumbhakasana, is one of the foundational poses in yoga. A high plank roll is a variation to the traditional plank pose. Singh said, “It provides stability and strength to the core muscles, which contain your oblique, lower back, and all of the side muscles. This exercise will also help enhance your twisting stability.To perform this move, go down on your fours. Make sure your hands are directly under your shoulders with your back and legs aligned in a straight line. Contract your abs and rotate and pivot towards the right. Press your hands while knocking your feet on the other side. Repeat this with the other leg as well.“Reverse lunges are an excellent way to work your hamstrings, glutes, calves and quads, while providing you with lower body strength,” said Singh. It is a great option for beginners as it is easy to control the backward motion.First, stand shoulder-width apart. Then, inhale and carefully take a big step backwards with your right foot as you bend both knees to 90 degrees, making sure your weight is distributed evenly between both legs. Now, exhale and extend both knees while transferring your weight onto your left foot. At the same time, raise your right foot to bring your knee near your chest. Lower your right leg to the starting position. Repeat this on the other side.Squats are one of the main movement patterns humans use in their daily life– we perform it every time we sit down and get up from a chair.  Singh said this movement helps strengthen lateral muscles. He added that it is beneficial for people who play sports like football and lawn tennis. “The side-to-side squats activate several muscle groups simultaneously, working the legs, glutes, and core. The squat increases performance and flexibility and the side-to-side movement improves dynamic balance and agility,” he added.To do this exercise, start with your feet shoulder-width apart and your hands in front holding each other. Then, start to hinge at the hips and bend your knees slightly. Ensure that your back is straight up. Now, push your leg to one side and bend your other knee. Bring the leg back so that both of them are together. Then, repeat the process to the other side.",

But the right preparatory or assisted exercises can help one ace any challenging exercise, believes fitness trainer Kayla Itsines. “I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, pull-ups are not impossible’…,” said Itsines.Pull ups help strengthen the back, arm and shoulder muscles. Besides improving grip strength, they also benefit overall body strength and flexibility. “Pull up is an amazing bodyweight movement that also helps build upper-body strength. It is a compound movement that involves multiple muscle groups, and is one of the best back-strengthening exercises,” said Sameeran Chetia, a certified fitness trainerThe best way to perform this movement is by hanging from a pull up bar and try pulling yourself up to the chin level, added Chetia.During movement, try to engage the muscles in your arms and back. When performed the right way, pull-up helps in strengthening the biceps, forearms, and core muscles. Another benefit you get from pull-ups is grip strength, which can help in day-to-day activities. It is a very simple movement but is effective at the same time with loads of benefits",

        DataDescription:"Fitness expert Namrata Purohit shares her tips and simple exercises on on how to fix lower back pain",
        DataDetailDescription:"Lower back pain is unfortunately common in adults, especially the ones who work at a desk all day. Fitness instructor and Pilates expert Namrata Purohit shared a video on her Instagram page that delves into what causes back pain, from the point of view of the body, and shared four tips that can help reduce or even get rid of the pain. “Back Pain, No Pain! Here are 4 tips to help reduce or get rid of lower back pain!,” she captioned the post.The first thing she attributes lower back pain to is our posture. It is no mystery that having a bad posture can harm our spine, and in turn cause pain. Namrata says the way to fix it is by doing isometric strength training. Simply put by doing planks. “Planks are a highly effective exercise activating the muscles for spinal stabilisation. So get strong!” A 2021 study by Gautam Gupta and Mayank Alok, published in the International Journal of Science and Research, found that “Plank training is useful in enhancing the quality of life and reducing pain in low back pain.”The next tip from Namarta is to strengthen the abs and our core. “The most important thing is to work the core. Working the abs and the core helps maintain proper spinal curvature and a neutral pelvic tilt which is important for preventing back pain. It also lifts the pressure of your spine,” the expert shares.Stiff hips are the third reason your lower back may be hurting. “Stiff hips can lead to lower back pain,” Namrata claims, adding, “A lack of rotational mobility and the ability to flex or extend your hips forward or backwards, can affect your walking and running. Every motion will increase the mechanical strain on your lower back.” To open your hips, exercises such as the reclined pigeon pose or extended child’s pose are ideal.The last tip is to build our glute muscles. “The glute muscles are the main stabilisers of the pelvis and help support the lower back. When these muscles are weak, you overcompensate by using the muscle in your back to stabalise the body. This adds stress and tension to the lower back,” she says. Bridge pose is an excellent pose to strengthen these muscles.",

        DataDescription:"Don't let the fear of pain or injury put you off from starting a new exercise regime. The benefits of exercise far outweigh the temporary feeling of muscle soreness that can accompany a new exercise regime",
        DataDetailDescription:"Getting in the habit of exercising isn’t easy. Not only is finding the time to exercise a major deterrent for people, the fear of aches, pain and injuries is also a reason that people put off starting a new exercise regime.But exercise doesn’t necessarily have to lead to pain or injuries. Here are some simple things you can do to avoid these when starting out.It’s important to warm up before your exercise. Warming up raises the temperature of the working muscles and the whole body. It also prepares your body for the increased stress of exercise. Muscles that have been warmed up are able to exercise for longer, and suffer less soreness and reduced injury risk.Exactly what constitutes an effective warm-up varies from workout to workout. But in general, you should dedicate at least five to ten minutes of your workout to warming up. Start with large, whole-body movements such as body-weight squats and lunges before progressing to more task-specific actions – such as a walk or jog before running, or lifting light weights before weight training. Your warm-up shouldn’t be too strenuous. Aim to use only about 40-60% of your maximum effort.A common mistake when starting a new exercise regime is to do too much. This can lead to pain after workouts, and may also increase your likelihood of injury.When you first begin a new workout plan, it’s important to start gradually and at your own pace. Since everyone is different, avoid following an exercise programme that uses absolute distances or repetitions. Instead, focus on how you feel during a workout and listen to what your body is telling youIt can take weeks or even months to notice the benefits of exercise, so don’t expect to see your health and fitness improve overnight. It’s also worth noting that progress isn’t always linear – some days you may find it’s difficult to exercise as long or as hard as you did the previous session. Listen to your body and stop when you feel tired, to avoid injury.",

        DataDetailDescription:"During winter, many people fall sick with seasonal colds and flu, which can take a toll on the body. As such, Aditi Zawar, a yoga instructor, who often shares videos on wellness, took to Instagram to share a yoga asana that she said can help prevent us from falling sick owing to the weather changes. “It is getting extremely cold out there. If you are someone who is prone to infections like cold, cough, or other flu-related to the colder seasons, here is one prayanam that can help you warm your body,” she said in the video.Stressing “breath is medicine”, she demonstrated ‘suryabhedi pranayama‘, a breathing technique that requires the practitioner to inhale from the right nostril while holding the other one with a finger and then exhaling through the left nostril. This, she suggested, can be done 8 to 10 times a day.Explaining its benefits she said, “The suryabhedi pranayama activates the sun element in our body and keeps it warm. . It helps improve your ability to fight flus and infections like cold, sinusitis, bronchitis, Covid, and other respiratory problems. It also purifies the blood and helps relieve symptoms of indigestion.”Agreeing, yoga trainer Ira Trivedi said that as the pranayama — which focuses only on the right nostril (also known as surya nadi or Pingala) — activates the Surya nadi, which helps kickstart one’s metabolism. “Since the practice aggravates the pitta dosha, it stimulates the digestive fire and aids proper digestion. It further eliminates digestive worms and addresses diseases afflicting the digestion tract, like gas and bloating.”",

        DataDetailDescription:"About half of Americans said they experienced stress within the past day, according to a Gallup Poll survey from last October, a finding that was consistent for most of 2022. Personal finances and current and political events were major sources of stress for one-third or more of adults, a survey from CNN in partnership with the Kaiser Family Foundation found in October.Stress isn’t inherently bad, said Richard Scrivener, a personal trainer and product development manager at London’s Trainfitness, an education technology company. Stressing your muscles through weight training, for example, leads to beneficial changes. In addition, short-term stress in healthy people typically isn’t a hazard. “But if stress is continuous, especially in older or unhealthy individuals, the long-term effects of the response to stress may lead to significant health issues,” Scrivener said.Stress occurs when you face a new, unpredictable or threatening situation, and you don’t know whether you can manage it successfully, said clinical psychologist Dr. Karmel Choi, an assistant professor in the Center for Precision Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.Luckily, there are many ways to combat stress. Keep a daily routine, get plenty of sleep, eat healthy foods, and limit your time following the news or engaging in social media, recommends the World Health Organization. It also helps to stay connected with others and to employ calming practices such as meditation and deep breathing. One of the most successful tools, though, is physical activity.Exercise is remarkably effective for managing psychological stress,” Choi said. “Exercise doesn’t remove what’s causing the stress, but it can boost mood, reduce tension and improve sleep — all of which are impacted by stress — and ultimately this can support people to approach their challenges in a more balanced way.Numerous studies back up the positive effect of exercise on stress. Physical activity, and especially exercise, significantly reduced the symptoms of anxiety in a study published in Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology, for example. Similarly, a Frontiers in Psychology study of university students found that regularly engaging in low- to moderate-intensity aerobic exercises for six weeks helped alleviate their depressive symptoms and perceived stress.",

        DataTitle:"14 Benefits of Strength Training,Click here to know more",
        DataDetailDescription:"1. Makes you stronger Strength training helps you become stronger.Gaining strength allows you to perform daily tasks much easier, such as carrying heavy groceries or running around with your kids (3Trusted Source, 4Trusted Source).Furthermore, it helps improve athletic performance in sports that require speed, power, and strength, and it may even support endurance athletes by preserving lean muscle mass (3Trusted Source, 4Trusted Source).2. Burns calories efficiently Strength training helps boost your metabolism in two ways.First, building muscle increases your metabolic rate. Muscles are more metabolically efficient than fat mass, allowing you to burn more calories at rest (5Trusted Source, 6Trusted Source).Second, research shows that your metabolic rate is increased up to 72 hours after strength-training exercise. This means that youre still burning additional calories hours and even days after your workout (7Trusted Source, 8Trusted Source).3. Decreases abdominal fat .Fat stored around the abdomen, especially visceral fat, is associated with an increased risk of chronic diseases, including heart disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer (9Trusted Source, 10Trusted Source, 11Trusted Source, 12Trusted Source).Multiple studies have shown the benefit of strength-training exercises for reducing abdominal and total body fat (13Trusted Source, 14Trusted Source, 15Trusted Source).4. Can help you appear leaner As you build more muscle and lose fat, you will appear leaner.This is because muscle is more dense than fat, meaning it takes up less space on your body pound for pound. Therefore, you may lose inches off of your waist even if you dont see a change in the number on the scale.Also, losing body fat and building stronger and larger muscles showcases more muscle definition, creating a stronger and leaner appearance.5. Decreases your risk of fallsStrength training lowers your risk of falls, as youre better able to support your body (16Trusted Source, 17Trusted Source, 18Trusted Source). In fact, one review including 23,407 adults over the age of 60 showed a 34% reduction in falls among those who participated in a well-rounded exercise program that included balance exercises and resistance and functional training (18Trusted Source).Fortunately, many forms of strength training have been shown to be effective, such as tai chi, weight training, and resistance band and bodyweight exercises (19Trusted Source, 20Trusted Source, 21Trusted Source, 22Trusted Source).6. Lowers your risk of injury Including strength training in your exercise routine may reduce your risk of injury.Strength training helps improve the strength, range of motion, and mobility of your muscles, ligaments, and tendons. This can reinforce strength around major joints like your knees, hips, and ankles to provide additional protection against injury (1Trusted Source).Whats more, strength training can help correct muscular imbalances. For example, having a stronger core, hamstrings, and glutes takes the load off of your lower back during lifting, decreasing your risk of lower-back injuries (23Trusted Source, 24Trusted Source, 25Trusted Source, 26Trusted Source).Finally, adult and teenage athletes that engage in strength training have a lower likelihood of injury (27Trusted Source, 28Trusted Source, 29Trusted Source).In fact, one review including 7,738 athletes found strength-training programs reduced the risk of injury by 33%. It was found to lower the risk of injury in a dose-dependent manner, meaning for every 10% increase in strength-training volume, there was a 4% reduced risk of injury (30Trusted Source).7. Improves heart health Multiple studies have shown that regular strength-training exercise can decrease blood pressure, lower total and LDL (bad) cholesterol, and improve blood circulation by strengthening the heart and blood vessels (31Trusted Source, 32Trusted Source, 33Trusted Source, 34Trusted Source).Strength training also can help you maintain a healthy body weight and manage your blood sugar levels. High blood sugar levels are a major risk factor for heart disease (31Trusted Source).8. Helps manage your blood sugar levels Strength training may lower your risk of developing diabetes and can help those with the condition manage it better.Skeletal muscle helps increase insulin sensitivity. It also reduces blood sugar levels by removing glucose from the blood and sending it to muscle cells. As a result, greater muscle mass can help improve blood sugar management (35Trusted Source, 36Trusted Source, 37Trusted Source, 38Trusted Source).Strength training may also reduce your risk of developing diabetes. One study following 35,754 women for an average of 10 years showed a 30% reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes among those who engaged in strength training compared with those who did not (39Trusted Source).9. Promotes greater mobility and flexibility Contrary to popular belief, strength training can make you more flexible.Strength training increases joint range of motion (ROM), allowing for greater mobility and flexibility. Plus, those with weaker muscles tend to have lower ROM and flexibility (40Trusted Source).In fact, a recent review comparing stretching with strength training found they were equally effective at increasing ROM (41Trusted Source).For best results, ensure youre completing the full ROM of an exercise — in other words, utilize your full movement potential around a joint. For example, lower yourself into a squat as far as youre able to go without compromising your form (42Trusted Source, 43Trusted Source).10. Boosts your self-esteemStrength training can add a major boost to your self-confidence.It helps you overcome challenges, work toward a goal, and appreciate your bodys strength. In particular, it can increase your self-efficacy — the belief that youre able to succeed at or perform a task — which can greatly improve your confidence (44Trusted Source, 45Trusted Source, 46Trusted Source, 47Trusted Source).In fact, one review of 7 studies in youth ages 10–16 years observed a significant association between strength training and high self-esteem, physical strength, and physical self-worth (47Trusted Source).Additionally, a systematic review that studied 754 adults showed a significant link between strength training and positive body image, including body satisfaction, appearance, and social physique anxiety (the perception of judgment from others) (48Trusted Source).11. Makes your bones stronger Strength training is crucial for bone development.Weight-bearing exercises put temporary stress on your bones, sending a message to bone-building cells to take action and rebuild bones stronger. Having strong bones reduces your risk of osteoporosis, fractures, and falls, especially as you age (49Trusted Source, 50Trusted Source, 51Trusted Source, 52Trusted Source).Fortunately, you can reap the bone-strengthening benefits of strength training at any age.12. Boosts your mood Regular weight training may boost your mood and improve your mental health.Multiple studies have shown that strength training may reduce anxiety and boost your mood (53Trusted Source, 54Trusted Source, 55Trusted Source, 56Trusted Source).Strength training confers multiple benefits to mood regulation, such as increased self-esteem and self-efficacy. Whats more, exercise promotes the release of mood-boosting endorphins, which can play a role in a positive mood (53Trusted Source, 54Trusted Source, 57Trusted Source).13. Improves brain health Those who engage in strength training may have better brain health and protection against age-related cognitive decline.Multiple studies in older adults have pointed to significant improvements in cognitive function (e.g., processing speed, memory, and executive function) after participating in strength training, compared with those who did not participate in it (58Trusted Source, 59Trusted Source, 60Trusted Source, 61Trusted Source).Its thought that resistance training has many neuroprotective effects, such as improved blood flow, reduced inflammation, and an increased expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is linked to memory and learning (62Trusted Source, 63Trusted Source, 64Trusted Source).14 Promotes a better quality of life Strength training may increase your quality of life, especially as you age.Numerous studies have linked strength training to increased health-related quality of life, defined as a persons perceived physical and mental well-being (65Trusted Source, 66Trusted Source).In fact, one review of 16 studies including adults ages 50 years and older showed a significant correlation between resistance training and better mental health, physical functioning, pain management, general health, and vitality ",

        DataTitle:"Should You Wear a Lifting Belt When Strength Training?",
        DataDetailDescription:"If you regularly hit up the weight room, you may have noticed some folks with lifting belts strapped around their waists as they deadlift, squat, or do other big moves. The belts can look like a wider version of a traditional belt—leather with a buckle closure—or come with a wide Velcro closure instead. But do they have a purpose—besides making you look like a hard-core Olympic lifter? And, maybe more importantly, should you be wearing one too?Lifting belts do serve a purpose. But theyre best used only in certain circumstances: when youre lifting heavy weight, and your goal is to lift even heavier weight.Below, we dig into everything you need to know about lifting belts, including what they are, how they work, and when you may want to consider strapping one on.Basically, a weight belt—which wraps and fastens around your abdomen just like a traditional belt—helps you lift safely by providing core-bracing support that protects your spine. Your core muscles help protect your spine while strength training, and a weight lifting belt helps provide extra support to them. Your core muscles fire during compound exercises like the deadlift, squat, or overhead press to help support your spine and keep you from falling forward or backward (bending or flexing) under heavy loads. Remember, your core actually includes your diaphragm on the front of your body, obliques on your sides, and muscles (called the spinal erectors) on your back, as well as your transverse abdominis—your innermost, deep core muscles, which are often referred to as your bodys internal weight lifting belt. All of these muscles engage to help support your spine and complete a movement.Engaging your core, or core bracing, involves breath too. When powerlifters lift heavy loads, they take a breath into their abdomen, engage their core muscles, and hold the breath throughout the rep, exhaling at the top of the move. This creates intra-abdominal pressure so their entire trunk stays stiff when hefting heavy weight, exercise physiologist Tom Holland, MS, CSCS, author of The Micro-Workout Plan, tells SELF. (This technique is called the Valsalva maneuver, and theres been much internet and scientific debate over its safety. In short, its a breathing method thats not intended for beginners and should not be practiced without working alongside a pro first. Whats more, if you have high blood pressure, other heart conditions, or are pregnant, you shouldnt use this technique. Thats because it increases intra-abdominal pressure within the cavity where your lungs and heart are, Tessia DeMattos, DPT, CSCS, certified strength and conditioning specialist and powerlifting coach, tells SELF. Instead, you should inhale and exhale as you normally would So, where does a weight belt come in with all of this? In theory, these belts simply give you extra support, by providing more compression force to your core. This force helps increase the pressure you have within your core and create more stiffness, says DeMattos. The added stiffness means your spine remains better supported, and, theoretically, you may be able to lift more powerfully as a result.While the mechanism above is sound, the actual research on weight lifting belts—especially in a strength training setting—is a little more hazy.“The research into the efficacy of weight belts is mixed and surprisingly limited,” says Holland. We need more (current!) research on belts for performance and for injury prevention, he says, as well as more research on belts for people in gym settings rather than occupational environments. (Lots of the existing research on belts focuses on people who lift heavy weights for work, like delivery employees or stock unloaders But here are a few examples of what the science says so far. A large JAMA study in 2000 looked at nearly 14,000 retail employees who regularly loaded and unloaded heavy boxes as part of their jobs and wore lifting belts. The study found belts were not associated with any reduction in risk of back injuries or low back pain. In other words, wearing the back belts made no difference when it came to protecting against injury. Scientists supported that viewpoint six years later in a review of 22 studies in the Strength and Conditioning Journal, which looked at weight belts in both occupational and industrial settings, as well as those in workout environments. The scientists concluded there was “a general lack of evidence” for any benefits for weight belts on the job.But comparing weight belts used in the gym to those in work settings isnt exactly apples to apples, the authors of the same review write, since the weight is typically lower and more endurance based in a job setting. When researchers looked at weight belts used in workouts, the conclusions were a little different: “Theres no strong evidence against the use of lifting belts,” the authors of the review wrote. Of the eight studies they analyzed that focused on sport settings, five suggested some benefit—mainly for reducing spinal compression, stabilizing the spine, and increasing velocity of the exercise—two found mixed results, and one found no positive outcomes. More recently, a small 2022 study on recreational weight lifters found that using belts, in addition to wrist straps (which support your grip when lifting heavy), helped the lifters to complete deadlifts faster and with better biomechanics than when they werent wearing either. This suggests that the lifting belts and straps provided a greater sense of support, which improved lifting performance. ",

        DataDetailDescription:"Hugh Jackman is back in training to play Wolverine for the tenth time in the upcoming Deadpool 3, his first official appearance as the character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The actor has promised that this Data version of the character will be angrier than ever, and his intense prep for the movie seems to reflect this: Jackman is hitting two workouts and eating 8,000 calories per day.In a recent video on the Buff Dudes channel, bodybuilder and YouTuber Hudson White spends the day eating and working out like Jackman, and soon finds that the Wolverine routine is not for the faint of heart.For one thing, it costs $180 to buy and prepare just one day's worth of food in Jackman's diet. White usually only consumes around 2,500 calories per day, and so eating 8,000 calories across six meals is an insane challenge in itself. There's only been a few times in my life that I've actually surpassed 5,000 calories, and it's just been a chore, he says. How am I going to put all of this in my body in a 12-hour period?For the first workout of the day, White focuses on lower body, performing the trap bar deadlift, cyclist squats (a staple of old-school bodybuilding), forward/reverse lunges, jumping split squats, and seated calf raises, spending nearly two hours in the gym.Once he has refueled, the second workout of the day is a shorter one, taking just 45 minutes and consisting of pullups, bench press, double clap pushups, single-arm banded flys, dumbbell shoulder press, weighted cross bench dips, dumbbell bicep curls, and decline mobility ball crunches.After following Jackman's routine for just one day, White finds that the usual pleasure he takes from exercising and enjoying food is starting to wane, due to the strictly regimented, high-volume nature of what is required to physically transform for a superhero role.Sadly, doing it this way,when you're having two workouts a day, when you're trying to put 8,000 calories in your body, it's a chore, it's a full-time job really, and I don't like it to be completely honest, I'm not a fan of this, and if I had to do this for a long period of time, I would lose the joy of lifting and eating. The way these actors are doing it, they're yo-yoing for the role and what it requires of them, but for me, I could not do this.",

        DataTitle:"How to Do the Trap Bar Deadlift to Transform Your Workouts",
        DataDetailDescription:"THE STRAIGHT BAR deadlift is widely esteemed as a strength training essential. For good reason, too: The compound lift fires up the hamstrings and glutes, while engaging other muscles through your quads, back, and abs. For most guys, deadlift day begins and ends with the Olympic (or straight) barbell. This unforgiving implement is generally how most strength sports (like powerlifting and strongman) engage with the deadlift, and it is a useful tool to build strength and size—but it might not be the most functional way to train the movement. That distinction goes to another piece of gear: the trap bar.The trap bar shifts your grip from the front of your body to the sides, which is a much more natural way to lift a heavy load off the floor. When youre hinging over to pick up a heavy load of groceries (we see you and your six bags in each arm), youre probably not ending up with the bags in front of your thighs—but thats the way that you lift when you do the barbell deadlift. Youd struggle to walk those bags into the house if you hold them in that same position. Were used to carrying loads on our sides, so why not train our deadlifts the same way?This is where the trap bar has an advantage over the traditional barbell. The bar is fixed in a hexagonal shape, with neutral grip handles in the center. The lifter is able to grasp the load at a natural angle, aiding a more comfortable pull. This reinforces natural movement by situating the load more centrally, all while packing on heavy weights like the straight bar.Still, doing the trap bar deadlift isnt as simple as just pulling the weight off the floor. Like other variations, the trap bar deadlift requires the proper mechanics, says Mens Health fitness director Ebenezer Samuel C.S.C.S., as he and fitness editor Brett Williams, N.A.S.M., demonstrate the essentials that can keep your heavyweight lifts safe and effective.Benefits of the Trap Bar DeadliftYou'll have a more natural motion when you lift. “It's going to be a lot easier and a lot more natural for you to pick up in the trap bar",

Don’t have a 12-inch oven-and broiler-proof skillet? Transfer the mixture to a 9- x 13-inch broiler-safe baking pan before baking and broiling in step 4.

Pav Bhaji is not only a sure-shot party pleaser but also a wholesome satisfying weeknight dinner.  Mumbai Pav Bhaji is quite popular all over India as one of the most loved and flavorful street food. The best part I like about making Mumbai Pav Bhaji, is that you don’t have to be super precise in your initial prep and chopping. First, cook the roughly chopped vegetables together in the ginger-garlic, onion-tomato base. Next, lightly mash the cooked veggies, bringing forth the distinctly spicy-tangy flavors. The final dish is incredibly tasty and presentable, you will be surprised at how little effort went into making this goodness!A great combination of nutritious mixed vegetables in a lip-smacking tomato base, Paav Bhaji is one of the best ways to get your kids to eat their veggies.The Curry (Bhaji) is served with soft buns or dinner rolls AKA pav that are not sweet. In the US, some cities have Indian Bakeries such as Hot Breads that make the traditional Indian Pav. If you have one near you, do grab their fresh soft buns, For the rest of us who may not have easy access to teh traditional Pav, buy buns or soft rolls from grocery stores that have 2 grams of sugar or less. I prefer buying soft potato buns, burgers buns, or Whole foods dinner rolls.The best way to serve piping hot Pav Bhaji is with warm buttery rolls or buns. Spoon the bhaji onto plates, sprinkle with red onion, and serve with the toasted buns and lime or lemon wedges on the side. You can also place the bhaji directly on the buns and serve it like sloppy joes. I often like to pair pav bhaji with either Veg Pulao or Sweet Coconut Rice for a full meal that works great for entertaining, game nights, or movie nights.",

So, if you have been scouting for recipes to break or begin your fast with, celebrity fitness expert Yasmin Karachiwala has an easy, delicious, and nutritious chia pudding recipe that you can easily whip up for sehri.“Ramadan Kareem everyone!

It’s packed with essential nutrients to keep you feeling full and satisfied throughout the day,” Karichawala wrote in an Instagram post, as she shared the nutritious recipe.Add ½ cup milk of choice and ½ cup mangoes to a blender. Blend until smooth Add blueberry mix along with 2 tbsp chia seeds, 2 tsp maple syrup , and ½ tsp vanilla extract to a mason jar Mix together and let sit in the fridge for a minimum of 3 hours, but preferably overnight.Stir together, then add toppings like plain Greek yoghurt and fresh mango slices Enjoy!Chia pudding can be a great option for suhoor, as it is high in fiber, protein, and healthy fats. Speaking with indianexpress.com, Sameena Ansari – Senior Dietitian and Nutritionist, CARE Hospitals, Hi-Tec City, Hyderabad, said: “The fiber and protein in chia seeds can help to keep you feeling full and satisfied throughout the day, which can be especially helpful during Ramadan, when meals are limited. Chia seeds are also a good source of omega-3 fatty acids, which can help reduce inflammation and support overall health”.*Chia seeds absorb a lot of liquid, so it is important to use the right ratio of chia seeds to liquid to avoid a clumpy or dry texture.*Chia seeds can be a choking hazard if not properly soaked and hydrated, so consume them carefully.While chia pudding can be a healthy addition to your suhoor meal, it is important to balance it with other nutritious foods to ensure that you are getting all of the nutrients that your body needs.",
